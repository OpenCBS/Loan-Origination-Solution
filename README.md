# Loan-Origination-Solution
Workflow management application allowing multiple users and roles to review, contribute to, approve or reject loan applications

The OpenCBS Loan Origination Solution manages loan application, underwriting and approval based on the workflows of financial institutions. Depending on product, loan amount, client type, application channel or other factors, the loan application can be routed through a specific workflow, and be approved by the relevant persons or Credit Committee.

Checks with Anti-Money Laundering blacklists or Credit Bureau can be set-up, and the solution be linked to a scoring system in order to automate partly or fully the credit decisioning process.

A task management interface allows the user to follow loans that are pending, sent for re-work or rejected, and have a clear view of the loans in the pipeline.

Combined with the OpenCBS Mobile Application, the OpenCBS Loan Origination Solution allows a complete digitisation of the Loan application and underwriting process, integrated with OpenCBS Cloud or a third-party Core Banking System.
